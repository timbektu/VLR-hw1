# hw1

We strongly suggest using conda (or miniconda) for package management. We wrote this assignment using a conda environment with python 3.7, but using a later version should work too.

For this assignment, please install PyTorch (`torch`, `torchaudio`, and `torchvision`) for your system, following the instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

You will also need to install `matplotlib` and `tensorboard`. For any other package dependencies, use conda to install as they come up as needed for your individual system.
